For all the pain?\nIf I would've known, if I would've known\nIf I would have known it could have been you\nIf I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new\nI never wanted to be, wanted to be your enemy\nNo, but if I, if I would've known\nIf I would have known it could have been you, been you\nThe repercussions of missing your loving\nHaunts me at night, the ghosts are alive\nAll of the memories\nA serenity dwindle in my mind\nAll the time\nLike a permanent stain wishing I could just wash away, away\nPrayed our love wasn't vain\nWho was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain?\nIf I would've known, if I would've known\nIf I would have known it could have been you\nIf I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new\nI never wanted to be, wanted to be your enemy\nNo, but if I, if I would've known\nIf I would have known it could have been you, been you\nIf I would've known, if I would've known\nIf I would have known it could have been you\nIf I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new\nI never wanted to be, wanted to be your enemy\nNo, but if I, if I would've known\nIf I would have known it could have been you, been you"
